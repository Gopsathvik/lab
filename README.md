## Welcome to Talha's GitHut Webpage

We will go over an example of creating and merging pull requests. It is a valuable skill that will come in handy in the future.

I started by creating a new repository that I will share with my class partner. They will:

1. Fork my repository 
2. Make a change
3. Send me a pull request

I don't imagine it getting much tricky. Let's hope for the best!
